# About Me {#about-me}

I am a dedicated and high-achieving student pursuing a double degree in Environmental Chemistry and Economics at Peking University, with a strong academic record (GPA: 3.809/4.00, top 10% in college). My research focuses on the molecular composition of full-volatility organic compounds in urban areas, and I have gained valuable international experience through exchange programs at the University of Manchester and UC Berkeley. I am passionate about exploring the intersection of environmental science, public health, and data science, and aim to contribute to sustainable solutions for global environmental challenges.
